### Finally !
---
Hello, So if you are reading this then probably I've finally made my blog site after several attempts. When I came to KGP I use to stalk Github profile of my seniors (xD). And I was amazed by seeing there blog webites. Some where so beautiful while others had so much content to learn from it. From then on I decided that one day I'll also make one for myself. 

And it took me almost one year to make it (Please Don't ask why). So from now I'll be spamming it whatever I feel like stuffs. Also I'll try to write some techincal blogs (Although I'm not good at it).
